            <h2>The Big Daddy</h2>
        <img class="kill" src="/danger.jpg" alt="A Big Daddy enemy that is about to kill a Splicer">
          <p class="introText" > Towering, relentless, and iconic, the Big Daddy is one of the most memorable enemies in the BioShock universe.
             Clad in a heavy, rusted deep-sea diving suit and armed with either a massive drill or a powerful rivet gun, the Big Daddy was originally designed to protect the genetically modified "Little Sisters" as they roam the underwater city of Rapture harvesting ADAM—a valuable genetic material.
            Despite their intimidating appearance, Big Daddies aren't inherently aggressive—unless provoked or if their Little Sister is threatened. 
            Once angered, they become nearly unstoppable juggernauts, capable of charging at terrifying speeds, 
            shaking the ground with their stomps, and tearing enemies apart with brutal efficiency.
            Their haunting whale-like moans and glowing porthole eyes—yellow when calm, red when enraged—serve as eerie warnings to any nearby intruders. 
            Taking down a Big Daddy is a test of strategy, firepower, and perseverance, often rewarding the player with precious ADAM and a moral choice regarding the fate of the Little Sister.
            Whether viewed as a tragic protector or a monstrous obstacle, the Big Daddy remains a symbol of BioShock’s dystopian beauty and moral complexity.
