          <h2>Welcome to the 2007 classic video game of BioShock!!</h2>
        <img class="mainDad" src="/BigDaddy.jpg" alt="image of a big daddy enemy">
          <p class="introText" >BioShock is a critically acclaimed first-person shooter video game developed by 2K Boston (later known as Irrational Games) and released in 2007. 
            Set in the 1960s, the game plunges players into the eerie, underwater city of Rapture—a failed utopia built by the enigmatic industrialist Andrew Ryan. 
            As the protagonist, Jack, you uncover the city’s dark secrets while battling mutated citizens known as Splicers, as well as the iconic, 
            armored Big Daddies who protect the eerie Little Sisters—young girls used to harvest a genetic material called ADAM.
            What sets BioShock apart is its philosophical undercurrent, drawing heavily on themes of objectivism, free will, and dystopian ideals. The game combines atmospheric storytelling, 
            immersive world-building, and RPG-style mechanics to create a deeply memorable experience. Its famous twist mid-game and the question, "Would you kindly?", 
            have cemented BioShock as a landmark title in gaming history.

            The world of BioShock is as much a character as any of its inhabitants. 
            Rapture, the game's setting, was envisioned as a haven for society’s elite—artists, scientists, and thinkers free from government, religion, or moral restraint. Built deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean, 
            the city was designed to be a utopia where human potential could thrive without interference. But what was meant to be a paradise quickly turned into a dystopian nightmare.
            The discovery of ADAM, a genetic substance extracted from sea slugs, allowed residents to alter their DNA, granting them extraordinary powers called Plasmids—from shooting fire and electricity to telekinesis. 
            However, the rampant use of ADAM and the societal decay it caused led to chaos. As addiction, power struggles, and social inequality took over, Rapture descended into civil war and madness.
            Walking through its crumbling halls, players are immersed in a haunting blend of art deco architecture, eerie jazz music, and environmental storytelling. Flickering neon signs, blood-streaked walls, and the occasional whispered lullaby from a Little Sister remind you that Rapture is a world both breathtaking and broken—a fallen dream of unchecked ambition.
