            <h2>The Little Sisters of Rapture</h2>
        <img class="lilSis-pic" src="/little-sister-halloween-costume.jpg" alt="A startling and creepy image of a Little Sister.">
          <p class="introText" > The Little Sisters are some of the most haunting and tragic characters in the BioShock universe. 
            These innocent-looking young girls have been twisted into something far darker by the underwater city of Rapture. 
            Once ordinary children, they have been genetically altered to harvest ADAM, a potent substance that grants its user the ability to manipulate and enhance their genes. 
            This substance, created from the remains of deceased sea life, becomes the key to the genetic arms race that tears Rapture apart.
            In the game, the Little Sisters are often found wandering the depths of Rapture, accompanied by their ever-watchful protectors—the Big Daddies. 
            The girls themselves are small, pale, and gaunt, with glowing eyes and an eerie, almost ethereal presence. 
            They speak in a singsong, unsettling voice, repeating phrases like "I'm gonna tell Mother what I saw" or "She will be proud of me." 
            This surreal innocence masks the horror of what they have become.
            The transformation into a Little Sister strips away their humanity, turning them into tools for the collection of ADAM. 
            They carry large needles designed to extract ADAM from the bodies of the dead, a process that has transformed them into semi-conscious beings, caught between their childhood innocence and the terrifying abilities they’ve been given.
            The moral dilemma surrounding the Little Sisters is central to BioShock's narrative. 
            Players are faced with a difficult choice: Rescue them, freeing them from their torment and offering a chance at redemption, or Harvest them for their ADAM, gaining immense power but condemning the girls to death. 
            This choice reflects the overarching themes of free will and the consequences of one's actions, asking players to decide between their desire for power and the value of innocence.
            Through these girls, BioShock explores the corruption of innocence, the horrors of genetic manipulation, and the cost of ambition. 
            The Little Sisters stand as a symbol of both the potential and the dark, irreversible consequences of Rapture's twisted pursuit of perfection.
