          <p class="introText" > In the shadowy depths of Rapture, ADAM is the lifeblood of power — a genetic substance harvested from sea slugs and Little Sisters. 
            This mysterious material rewrites DNA, allowing users to manipulate the very fabric of their biology. With ADAM, the impossible becomes reality. 
            Fire erupts from fingertips, swarms of insects can be summoned with a flick of the wrist, and flesh bends to the will of the mind. 
            These abilities come in the form of Plasmids — unstable yet intoxicating serums that grant superhuman capabilities at a dangerous cost.
            As citizens of Rapture fell deeper into addiction, their humanity slipped away, transforming them into violent, disfigured Splicers. In this decaying utopia, power is bought not with money, 
            but with ADAM — and the price may be your soul.
            Those who control the ADAM supply control Rapture itself. 
            Big Daddies roam the corridors, protecting Little Sisters as they extract the precious resource from the fallen. 
            To survive, one must choose between morality and power — harvest or rescue. Each Plasmid injection brings strength, but also madness, twisting the user further from who they once were.
