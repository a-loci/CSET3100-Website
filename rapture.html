          <h2>The Years Before Rapture's Fall</h2>
          <p>In the years leading up to Rapture's collapse, the city thrived as a utopian dream founded by Andrew Ryan. 
            Its residents—visionaries in science, art, and industry—enjoyed a society free from government and moral constraints. 
            The discovery of ADAM, a powerful genetic material, fueled rapid scientific advancements, particularly in genetic engineering, creating Plasmids that granted incredible abilities.
            However, the pursuit of power through ADAM led to a genetic arms race, causing corruption, greed, and exploitation. 
            The elite class flourished while the working class struggled. As more people began to abuse Plasmids, insanity and mutations spread, creating Splicers—dangerous, deformed citizens.
            Tensions mounted as rival factions, including Fontaine, challenged Ryan’s rule. The city’s political, social, and economic systems fractured, culminating in a civil war. 
            The dream of a perfect society crumbled under the weight of unchecked ambition, leading to Rapture's eventual fall into chaos and destruction.

            <h2>What is Rapture?</h2>
        <img class="raptrue-pic" src="/rapture.jpg" alt="The Underwater City of Rapture">
          <p class="introText" > Rapture is not just the setting of BioShock—it is a character in itself. 
            An underwater city built as a utopian vision, Rapture was conceived by the ambitious industrialist Andrew Ryan as a place where the boundaries of society could be erased. 
            It was to be a sanctuary for the brilliant, the creative, and the powerful—free from the shackles of government, religion, and morality. A place where human potential could be fully realized without interference or limitation.
            Located beneath the Atlantic Ocean, Rapture was designed to be a marvel of engineering and architectural beauty, with grandiose art-deco structures, gleaming glass windows showing the depths of the sea, and high-tech facilities that pushed the boundaries of science and industry. 
            Its residents were encouraged to embrace a philosophy of objectivism, where the individual’s desires and achievements were paramount, and any kind of collective good was considered secondary.
            However, as with most grand utopian visions, Rapture quickly descended into chaos. The scientific discoveries that powered the city’s success—particularly the creation of ADAM, a substance that allowed genetic manipulation—became a curse. 
            <p class=introText>As the desire for more ADAM grew, so did the greed, corruption, and violence among Rapture’s inhabitants. The city’s population turned on itself, and soon, civil war broke out. 
            Plagues of madness and genetic mutations ravaged the people, turning many into horrific monsters known as Splicers, while the children who were tasked with harvesting ADAM became the tragic Little Sisters.
            The physical city, once a beacon of progress and freedom, now lies in ruins. Powerful currents of water have flooded its hallways, while decaying infrastructure and broken machinery add to the sense of dystopian desolation. 
            Yet even amidst its crumbling beauty, Rapture remains a testament to the fallibility of human nature and the dangers of unchecked ambition. 
            Throughout BioShock, Rapture is not just a backdrop; it is a reflection of the philosophical conflict at the heart of the game. 
            It is a place that represents the ideals of unfettered individualism and scientific progress taken to their extremes, with a constant underlying question: What happens when the pursuit of perfection leads to destruction?
            From its grandiose beginnings to its tragic downfall, Rapture stands as a haunting reminder of the consequences of living in a world where nothing and no one is held accountable. A place where, in the end, the dream of utopia becomes a nightmare.
